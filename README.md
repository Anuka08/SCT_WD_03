Description

This Tic Tac Toe web game is a classic implementation of the popular two-player game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Designed for a quick and engaging gameplay experience, it features a simple yet visually appealing interface and intuitive user interactions. Players take turns marking X or O on a 3x3 grid, and the first player to achieve three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins. This project is perfect for demonstrating the fundamentals of front-end web development and basic game logic using JavaScript.
